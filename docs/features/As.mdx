# As function

This function allows you to change the *underlying element type* of a component or integrate Orbiter with an external library like [React router](https://reactrouter.com/).

## Usage

To specify a new underlying type:

<Source dark language="tsx" code={`
import { as, TextLink } from "@workleap/orbiter-ui";

const TextLinkAsButton = as(TextLink, "button");

<TextLinkAsButton onClick={() => window.location.href = "/home"}>Home</TextLinkAsButton>
`} />

To integrate with a third party:

<Source dark language="tsx" code={`
import { as, TextLink } from "@workleap/orbiter-ui";
import { Link as ReactRouterLink } from "react-router-dom";

const RouterTextLink = as(TextLink, ReactRouterLink, { normalizeStyles: true });

<RouterTextLink to="/home">Home</RouterTextLink>
`} />

## How it works

Previously, all Orbiter components were accepting an as prop. Since we introduced TypeScript, the `as` prop has proven to be difficult. Dynamic typings based on a prop value is not Typescript forte.

To mitigate the problem, we choose to deprecate the `as` prop in favor of an `as(baseComponent, asComponent)` function. The `as()` function returns a new component which renders the provided `baseComponent` with `asComponent` as the underlying type and merges the typings of both components.
