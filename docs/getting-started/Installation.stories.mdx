# Installation

Multiple [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/orbiter-ui/packages) compose Orbiter. By creating a bundle package named [@workleap/orbiter-ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@workleap/orbiter-ui), we simplify the installation process and allow you to install Orbiter with just a single package.

> We assume you've already set up [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom). Otherwise, you'll get a warning at installation.

## Install packages

To install Orbiter, open a terminal at the root of your project workspace and run the following command:

<PackageInstallationSnippet packageName="bundle" />

## Import styles

Orbiter styles include the ShareGate font, a [CSS bootstrap](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-orbiter/tree/master/packages/css/src) and of course the component's styles.

To import Orbiter styles, add the following import declaration to your root stylesheet:

```css
/* index.css */

@import "@workleap/orbiter-ui/index.css";
```

## Set up your tooling environment

Orbiter offer an ESLint plugin to see in-context help in your IDE. This includes accessibility pointers, deprecation notices, and other helpful tips.

> This config is designed to complement the [suggested Workleap ESLint Configuration](https://github.com/gsoft-inc/wl-web-configs).

First, add the ESlint plugin to your dependencies:

```
npm install @orbit-ui/eslint-plugin eslint
```

Then, add the plugin to your ESlint config. For example, your `.eslintrc.json` file may look like this:

```json
{
    "$schema": "https://json.schemastore.org/eslintrc",
    "plugins": ["@orbit-ui"],
    "extends": [
        "plugin:@orbit-ui/recommended"
    ]
}
```

More about [ESlint configuration](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files)

## Configure your application

Below is an example of how to configure an application with a [pre-constructed](?path=/story/theming--page#option-3-retrieve-a-pre-constructed-theme-from-orbiter) ShareGate theme object:

```tsx
// index.ts

import { createThemeVars, ShareGateTheme, ThemeProvider } from "@workleap/orbiter-ui";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";

createThemeVars([ShareGateTheme]);

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!);
root.render(
    <ThemeProvider theme={ShareGateTheme} colorScheme="light">
        <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
);
```

Instead of harcoding the foundation values in Orbiter, we choose to implement a [theming system](?path=/docs/theming--page) allowing applications to supply their core values to Orbiter.

The theming system introduced a concept of theme object. To configure Orbiter, you'll need to build your own theme object or import a [pre-constructed](?path=/story/theming--page#option-3-retrieve-a-pre-constructed-theme-from-orbiter) one from Orbiter. The theme object will be used to render the foundation variables with the `createThemeVars` function and define a [theme provider](?path=/docs/theme-provider--default-story) at the root of your application.

### Start creating components

You're all set! You can start creating your application with Orbiter:

```jsx
import { Div, Text } from "@workleap/orbiter-ui";

export const App = () => (
  <Div backgroundColor="alias-warning">
    <Text color="alias-primary">Hello World!</Text>
  </Div>
);
```
