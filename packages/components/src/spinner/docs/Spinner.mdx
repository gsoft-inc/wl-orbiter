## Guidelines

### When to use

- To notify users that an action is in progress.

### Accessibility

- The spinner component has a [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) of `status` by default. When inside a parent component that is focusable, the spinner should have a role of `presentation` to prevent the screen reader from reading the spinner.
- The parent component should have a `aria-busy` attribute set to `true` when the spinner is visible.
- The parent component should have a `aria-live` attribute set to `polite`.

### Spinner vs Loader

- Use the spinner component insider another component. When the whole page is waiting for data, use a [loader](?path=/docs/loader--default-story) instead.

## Usage

### Default

A simple spinner.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.Default} />

### Size

A spinner can vary in size.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.Size} />

### Label

A spinner can have a label.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.Label} />

### Over background

You can change a spinner style when over a background by setting a color property on the spinner.

<Canvas of={SpinnerStories.OverBackground} />
