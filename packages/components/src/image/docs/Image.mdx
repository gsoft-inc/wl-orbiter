## Guidelines

### Accessibility

- An image must have an [`alt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/alt) attribute.
- If the image does not add more information to the existing context(decorative), use `alt=""`.

## Usage

### Shape

An image can use a different shape.

<Canvas of={ImageStories.Shape} />

### Size

An image size can be specifyied with the `width` and `height` props.

<Canvas of={ImageStories.Size} />

### Retina

You can let the browser decide which image is best to serve according to the user device screen pixel density.

It is highly recommended to serve a _1x_ image as well as a _2x_ image, twice the intended size. This assures the user has the best looking image possible.

_Avoid serving images that are unecessary big, images should be resized to the intended final image display size. This assures we don't waste bandwith for the user._

<Canvas of={ImageStories.Retina} />

## SvgImage

For some use cases, like dark mode support, an SVG image is a better fit than a standard PNG or JPG image. Orbiter provide a component for these images which will take care for you of the accessibility attributes and enforce a mandatory `aria-label` attribute.

<Canvas of={ImageStories.SVGImageStory} />

### Size

An SVG image size can be specified with the `width` and `height` props.

<Canvas of={ImageStories.SVGImageSize} />

### Color

An SVG image `stroke` and `fill` color can vary.

<Canvas of={ImageStories.Color} />
