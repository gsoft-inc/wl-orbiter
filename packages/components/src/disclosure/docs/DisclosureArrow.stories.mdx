## Usage

When a disclosure arrow is nested in a component implementing a `DisclosureContext`, the arrow will automatically change direction when `isOpen` state change.

<Preview>
    <Story name="context">
        <Disclosure>
            <Button variant="secondary">
                <Text>EVE Online</Text>
                <DisclosureArrow slot="end-icon" />
            </Button>
            <Div>Eve Online is a space-based, persistent world massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by CCP Games. Players of Eve Online can participate in a number of in-game professions and activities, including mining, piracy, manufacturing, trading, exploration, and combat (both player versus environment and player versus player).
