# Loader

<Tagline>A loader provides reassurance that content is currently being loaded, processing, or that change will occur on the page.</Tagline>

<ComponentInfo
    usage={"import { Loader } from \"@workleap/orbiter-ui\";"}
    githubPath="/packages/components/src/loader/src"
/>

## Guidelines

### When to use

- To give feedback for an entire page load.
- On page elements where the visual layout/format of the content being loaded is unknown.
- To indicate processing, or that change will occur on the page (rather than loading UI elements).

### Accessibility

- The loader has a [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) of `status` by default.
- The parent component should have a `aria-busy` attribute set to `true` when the loader is visible.
- The parent component should have a `aria-live` attribute set to `polite`.

### Loader vs Spinner

- When you need to give feedback for a user or system action, use a [spinner](?path=/docs/spinner--default-story) instead.

## Usage

- Avoid increasing the size of the Loader to maintain consistency with other indicators accross the application.
- Always center the Loader and position it close to where you want the user's attention to be once loading is complete.
- Ideally used on a body or surface background.
- The delay property should often be used to avoid flashing the loader when the loading time is very short.

### Default

This is the default loader.

<Canvas of={LoaderStories.Default} />

### Delay

A loader can appears after a short delay. This is to prevent the loader from appearing when the action is very fast.
By settings `delay` to `true`, the loader will appear after 300ms. You can also set a custom delay in milliseconds.
