// The focus restore logic has been greatly inspired from: https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/c2c187606d447a6daa185e0b0507c22883ab3147/packages/%40react-aria/focus/src/FocusScope.tsx#L324

// This restore focus hook only works because we use an animation to fade away the overlay. Without an animation, the active element will always be the body which
// will be out of scope. To fix this, it would probably requires this code to become a React element instead of a React hook.
